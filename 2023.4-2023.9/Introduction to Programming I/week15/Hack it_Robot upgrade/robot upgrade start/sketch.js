/*
Robot upgrade.

The robots have have their firmware upgraded. They have developed a range of new abilities and attributes!

You need to search through the complex robots object and highlight them in a couple of circumstances:

* We want to find any robot whose last name is Katan
* We want to recognise the robot with the highest IQ, they'll be useful for the most complex tasks
* The robot with the oldest serial number is getting old we need to identify them as they are ready for retirement
* One of the robots has gone rouge find the one whose abilities include "destroy humanity"
* Robots with narrow heads can't take all the upgrades, identify robots with heads less than 70 wide

The robots array has been created for you but you'll need to use the console to understand how it is made up.
Even though the robots are drawn as a grid the array is a single dimension.
When you have found a particular robot call the highlight function and it will be encircled in the browser output
you need to give the highlight function 4 arguments the robot object, and red, green and blue values to set the colour of the highlight.
